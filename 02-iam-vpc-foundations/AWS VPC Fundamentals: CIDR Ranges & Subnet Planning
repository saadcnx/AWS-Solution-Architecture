Introduction to VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

What is a VPC?
A secure, logically isolated network environment within AWS
Region-specific - cannot span across multiple AWS regions
Provides complete control over networking resources and configurations
Similar to having your own private data center within AWS infrastructure

VPC Isolation & Communication
Default isolation: Different VPCs cannot communicate with each other

Example Scenario:

Customer A's VPC cannot communicate with Customer B's VPC
Even within same AWS account, VPCs in different regions cannot communicate
Enabling communication: Requires VPC Peering configuration

Practical Example:
A company running applications in London region requires disaster recovery replication in US region → Must establish VPC Peering for connectivity

VPC Architecture Overview

Typical AWS Account Structure:

Select AWS Region
Create VPC within chosen region
Access to 3 Availability Zones (AZs) within region
Deploy servers across AZs for high availability

Core Component: CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

Understanding CIDR:
CIDR is the most critical component of VPC configuration - it defines the network address space for your virtual data center.

Private IPv4 Address Ranges (RFC 1918):
Range Name	               IP Address Range	           Total Addresses	 Common Notation
24-bit block (Class A)	10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255	      16,777,216	     10.0.0.0/8
20-bit block (Class B)	172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255	    1,048,576	       172.16.0.0/12
16-bit block (Class C)	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255  	65,536	         192.168.0.0/16

Key Concept:
When creating a VPC, you define a CIDR block (network range). Every resource (server, database, etc.) deployed within that VPC receives an IP address from this predefined range.

Understanding CIDR Notation
Example Analysis: 192.168.1.0/24
Total bits: 32 bits (IPv4 standard)

Network bits: 24 bits (prefix length)

Host bits: 8 bits (32 - 24 = 8)

Address Calculation:
Formula: 2^(host bits) = Total usable addresses

For /24: 2^8 = 256 total addresses

Usable hosts: 256 - 2 = 254 (excluding network and broadcast addresses)

Subnet Division Concept

Understanding Subnets:
Think of a CIDR block as a whole apple. When you divide it into pieces, each piece becomes a subnet (sub-network).

Subnet Division Example:
Original CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24 (256 addresses)

When divided into 2 subnets:
Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/25
IP Range: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.127
Total addresses: 128
Usable hosts: 126

Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128/25
IP Range: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.255
Total addresses: 128
Usable hosts: 126

Mathematics Behind Subnetting:
Original: /24 = 32-24 = 8 host bits

After dividing by 2: 2^7 = 128 addresses per subnet
New prefix: 24 + 1 = /25 (added 1 bit for subnetting)

Visual Representation:

Original: 192.168.1.0/24 (256 addresses)
         ↓ Divide into 2 equal parts ↓
  Subnet A: 192.168.1.0/25    (128 addresses)
  Subnet B: 192.168.1.128/25  (128 addresses)

Critical Best Practice
CIDR planning is your VPC's blueprint. Changing CIDR ranges after deployment is extremely difficult. Always carefully plan your network architecture from the beginning, considering:
Current requirements
Future growth
Multi-VPC connectivity needs
Integration with on-premise networks

Remember: Proper CIDR planning at the initial stage prevents costly architectural changes later in your project lifecycle.
