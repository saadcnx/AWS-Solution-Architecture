IAM User Authentication & Access Management

1. AWS Sign-in URL & Customization

Default Sign-in URL:
text
https://<your-account-id>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
Custom Alias (Recommended):
You can customize the sign-in URL with your company name:

text
https://mycompany.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
Configuration Steps:
Navigate to IAM Dashboard

Click "Customize" next to the sign-in URL
Enter your preferred alias (3-20 characters)

Benefits:
Professional appearance
Easy to remember
Brand consistency
Enhanced user experience

2. Billing Access for IAM Users

Important Security Feature:
By default, IAM users DO NOT have billing access, even with AdministratorAccess policy.
This is a separate security layer requiring manual configuration.

Enabling Billing Access:

Step 1: Enable IAM Billing Access
Login as Root User (original account owner)
Navigate to Billing Console
Select "Billing Preferences"
Enable: "IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information"

Step 2: Assign Billing Permissions
Attach billing-related policies to IAM users/groups:
AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess (View-only access)
Billing (Full billing management)

3. IAM User Creation Permissions
Can IAM Users Create Other Users?
Answer: YES — but only with explicit permissions.

Default Setting:
IAM users cannot create other users by default.

Granting User Creation Privileges:
Add these IAM actions to the user's policy:

json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:CreateUser",
        "iam:CreateGroup",
        "iam:AttachUserPolicy",
        "iam:AddUserToGroup",
        "iam:CreateAccessKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}

Security Recommendations:

For Billing Access:
Limit access to finance/administrative teams
Consider read-only access for most users
Root user should retain primary billing control
Enable detailed billing alerts and monitoring

For IAM Management Privileges:
Grant only to trusted administrators
Implement approval workflows for production changes
Enable CloudTrail logging for all IAM actions
Use permission boundaries to limit scope
Regularly audit user creation activities
Security Best Practices

Principle of Least Privilege:
Grant billing access only when necessary
Limit IAM creation rights to essential personnel
Implement temporary credentials for administrative tasks

Monitoring & Auditing:
Enable AWS CloudTrail for all regions
Set up budget alerts in Billing Console
Review IAM credential reports monthly
Implement S3 bucket policies for billing reports

Access Segregation:
Separate duties between IAM management and billing
Use different IAM users for different roles
Implement break-glass procedures for emergencies
