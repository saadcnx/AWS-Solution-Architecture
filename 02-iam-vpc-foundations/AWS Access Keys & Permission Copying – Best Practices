AWS Access Keys & Permission Copying 

1. Access Keys (Developer’s Lifeline)

Why Needed: Required for programmatic access via AWS APIs, CLI, or SDKs.

Examples:

Infrastructure deployment via Terraform or CloudFormation
Calling AWS services from Python/Java code
CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

Components:

Access Key ID: Like a username
Secret Access Key: Like a password (keep it secret!)

2. Permission Copying – Save Time & Effort

Use the “Copy permissions from existing user” option when:
Employee changes (e.g., admin1 → admin2)
New user needs the same permissions as an existing one
Benefit: Instead of manually adding 20+ groups, all permissions are copied with one click.

3. Access Key Management – Crucial Points

Secret Key is shown only once!
Save or download it immediately, otherwise a new key must be generated.
Safe Deletion Procedure:
Make the key inactive
Test that no system fails
Then delete

4. Real-World Scenario

Situation: Replace Admin1 (leaving company) with Admin2

Steps:

Create new user Admin2
Select “Copy permissions from existing user” → choose Admin1
Enable access keys for Admin2
Save secret key safely
Deactivate/delete Admin1’s keys

Pro Advice:
“Access keys are the master keys to your cloud. Never leave them unsecured! Save secret keys immediately in a password manager; otherwise, you’ll never get them back.”
