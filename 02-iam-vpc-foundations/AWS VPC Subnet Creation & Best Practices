AWS VPC Subnet Creation & Best Practices

Step-by-Step Subnet Creation
Navigation Path:
VPC Console → Subnets → Create subnet
Name tag: Assign descriptive name (e.g., web-subnet-az-a)
VPC: Select your target VPC from dropdown
Availability Zone: Choose specific AZ (e.g., ap-south-1a)
IPv4 CIDR block: Enter your subnet CIDR (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24)

AWS Network Hierarchy Structure

Clear Organizational Flow:
REGION (e.g., Mumbai/ap-south-1)
    ↓
   VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
    ↓
AVAILABILITY ZONES (ap-south-1a, 1b, 1c)
    ↓
SUBNETS (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24)

Subnet Design Principles
Key Architectural Rules:
✅ Allowed:
Multiple subnets within one Availability Zone

Example: AZ ap-south-1a can contain:
10.0.1.0/24 (Web tier)
10.0.2.0/24 (App tier)
10.0.3.0/24 (Cache tier)

❌ Not Allowed:
Single subnet spanning multiple Availability Zones
A subnet cannot extend across ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b

Real-World Production Example

Mumbai Region (ap-south-1) Architecture:
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16

Availability Zone ap-south-1a:
10.0.1.0/24 - Web servers (Public subnet)
10.0.2.0/24 - Application servers (Private subnet)
10.0.3.0/24 - Monitoring/Management (Private subnet)

Availability Zone ap-south-1b:
10.0.4.0/24 - Database primary (Private subnet)
10.0.5.0/24 - Database replica (Private subnet)
10.0.6.0/24 - Backup servers (Private subnet)

Availability Zone ap-south-1c:
10.0.7.0/24 - Disaster recovery (Private subnet)
10.0.8.0/24 - Testing/Staging (Isolated subnet)

Enterprise Best Practices

1. Multi-AZ High Availability Design:
Deploy each application tier across minimum 2 AZs

Web tier: Deploy in az-1a and az-1b
Database tier: Primary in az-1a, replica in az-1b
Load balancers: Distribute traffic across AZs

2. Standardized Naming Convention:
Format: <environment>-<tier>-<az>

Examples:

prod-web-1a - Production web servers in AZ 1a
dev-db-1b - Development database in AZ 1b
stg-app-1c - Staring application servers in AZ 1c
mgmt-mon-1a - Management monitoring in AZ 1a

3. CIDR Planning Strategy:
Reserve contiguous blocks for future expansion
Leave buffer ranges between different tiers
Document IP allocations for team reference
Consider VPC Peering requirements in advance

4. Subnet Size Guidelines:
Public subnets: /27 (32 addresses) for NAT/Internet Gateway
Web tier subnets: /24 (256 addresses) for auto-scaling
Database subnets: /27 (32 addresses) for RDS/Aurora
Management subnets: /28 (16 addresses) for admin access

Analogy for Better Understanding

Real-World Comparison:
VPC = Entire housing colony (secure, gated community)
Availability Zones = Different buildings within colony (physically separate)
Subnets = Individual rooms/floors (logically segmented for specific purposes)

Example:
Building A (AZ-1a): Ground floor (web), First floor (app), Second floor (cache)
Building B (AZ-1b): Ground floor (DB), First floor (backup), Second floor (DR)

Implementation Checklist
Before Creating Subnets:

Define clear naming convention
Calculate required IP addresses per tier
Plan for 30-50% future growth
Identify public vs. private subnet requirements
Document CIDR allocation plan

During Subnet Creation:

Verify VPC selection
Confirm Availability Zone
Double-check CIDR calculations
Apply appropriate tags
Review route table associations

Pro Tip: Your subnet design directly impacts application availability, security, and scalability. Invest time in proper planning - it's easier to design correctly from the start than to re-architect later. Document your network design and share with your team for consistent implementation.
