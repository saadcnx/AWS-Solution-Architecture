The Core Difference

Stop = Pause Button 🎮

Terminate = Delete Forever Button 🗑️

Technical Breakdown
STOP EC2 Instance

State: Instance shuts down → moves to stopped state

What persists:

Root EBS volume and data ✅
Additional EBS volumes ✅
Instance ID & configuration ✅
Elastic IP (if attached) ✅
ENI (Network Interface) ✅

Billing:

❌ No EC2 instance charge
✅ EBS storage charge applies (GB/month)
✅ Elastic IP charge applies if not attached to a running instance

Use Case:

Temporary shutdown for maintenance
Cost savings overnight
Debugging
TERMINATE EC2 Instance
State: Instance shuts down → moves to terminated state → deleted permanently

What gets deleted:

Root EBS volume (default behavior) ❌
Additional EBS volumes (if DeleteOnTermination: true) ❌
Instance itself ❌

Exception: Volumes with DeleteOnTermination: false survive

Billing:

❌ No EC2 charge
❌ No EBS charge (for deleted volumes)
✅ Elastic IP charge continues if not released

Use Case:

Permanent removal
Cleanup
Immutable infrastructure patterns

⚠️ Production Mistakes (Real Horror Stories)

Mistake: “I’ll just terminate this old instance…”
Reality: Deletes EBS volumes with customer data

Data Recovery: Near impossible unless snapshots exist
Mistake: “Stopped instances don’t cost money!”

Reality: Pays ₹5,000/month for 500GB of unused EBS volumes
Mistake: “Terminate = Instant”

Reality: Termination can take 60+ seconds. Someone might panic and force restart.
Solution: Either terminate (delete volumes) or take snapshots → delete volumes

Best Practices

Always enable termination protection for production instances
Tag everything: Environment=Prod, AutoDelete=No
Take regular snapshots before any major changes
Use Auto Scaling Groups instead of manual instance management
Test changes in lower environments before production
