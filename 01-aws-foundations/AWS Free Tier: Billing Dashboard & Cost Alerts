AWS Billing & Cost Management 
1. AWS Billing Dashboard

Location: Top-right corner → “Billing and Cost Management”

Here you can access:
Payments: Manage card details and view payment history.
Bills: View detailed monthly bills, broken down service-by-service.
Cost Management: Analyze where your money is being spent.

2. Billing Alerts (Your Safety Net!)

The 30GB storage example you mentioned is perfect.

Why are they important?
Cloud usage can easily go unnoticed (“out of sight, out of mind”), leading to unexpectedly high bills. Alerts help you stay informed and in control.

How it works:

Set a limit (e.g., $50).
When your current or forecasted bill exceeds this limit, AWS sends you an email or SMS alert.

Example:
You expected 30GB on S3, but your app goes viral and usage hits 31GB. The alert immediately notifies you, allowing you to control costs before it gets out of hand.

3. How to Set Billing Alerts (Simple Steps)

Open the Billing Console.
Navigate to “Billing Preferences” or “Budgets”.
Click “Create a Budget”.
Enter your limit amount and email ID.
Save — done! ✅

Tip: Never start using the cloud without billing alerts. Think of it like a seatbelt in your car — you won’t notice it, but one day it can save you from a big bill.
