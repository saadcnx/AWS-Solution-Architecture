1. What is AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is Amazon’s cloud computing platform. It provides data center resources globally on a rental basis, eliminating the need to own or maintain physical servers.

2. Pay-As-You-Go Model (Most Important)

AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, similar to your electricity bill — you pay only for what you use. There are no upfront costs and no long-term commitments. Stop using a service, and the billing stops automatically.

3. Main Service Models

AWS primarily offers three service models:

a) IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Definition: Rent raw infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking.
Examples: EC2 (Virtual Machines), S3 (Storage), VPC (Virtual Private Network)
Management Responsibility: You manage the OS, runtime, and applications; AWS handles only the hardware.

b) PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Definition: A platform where you can directly deploy your code without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
Examples: Elastic Beanstalk, RDS (Managed Databases)
Management Responsibility: AWS manages OS, runtime, scaling; you focus solely on your code.

c) SaaS (Software as a Service)

Definition: Ready-to-use software accessible via the cloud.
Examples: Salesforce, Office 365, AWS Chime

4. Global Infrastructure (AWS’s Strength)

AWS operates through Regions and Availability Zones (AZs) worldwide.

Region: A geographical area (e.g., Mumbai, Singapore)
Availability Zone (AZ): Separate physical data centers within a region. AZs ensure high availability — if one goes down, another continues serving traffic.

5. Key AWS Services

EC2: Virtual servers, the core of cloud computing.
S3: Highly scalable object storage, like an “infinite hard disk” on the internet.
VPC: Private cloud network, forming the foundation for security.
IAM: Access management, controlling who can do what.
RDS: Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) — database administration simplified.
Lambda: Serverless computing — write code without worrying about servers; billed only for execution time.

6. DevOps & AWS

AWS fully supports the DevOps lifecycle:
CI/CD: Use CodePipeline and CodeBuild for automated testing and deployment.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define your entire infrastructure in code using CloudFormation or Terraform — no more manual clicks.
Monitoring: CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring of resources and applications.

Final Note

AWS empowers you with scalability, reliability, and security, but it also follows a shared responsibility model:
AWS manages the underlying infrastructure.
You are responsible for securing your applications and data.
