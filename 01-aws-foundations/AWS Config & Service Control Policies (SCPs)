AWS Config – “Security Camera + Auditor”
Purpose: Continuous monitoring and recording of what resources exist and how they are configured.

Example:

Camera records: “EC2 instance X launched on Jan 10, SSH port open, not encrypted”
Auditor checks: “Is this EC2 instance compliant with our rules?”

Use Cases:

PCI DSS compliance checks
Ensure all S3 buckets are encrypted
Track configuration changes over time
Analogy: Like a CCTV + checklist guard that records every resource and verifies it against the rules.

Service Control Policies (SCPs) – “Boundary Wall + Gate Rules”
Purpose: Set permission boundaries for who can do what across entire AWS accounts.

Examples:

No one in the Dev account can create an EC2 instance larger than t3.large
No one can disable CloudTrail
No S3 buckets can be made public

Use Cases:

Prevent accidental creation of expensive resources
Enforce security guardrails
Control allowed regions/services
Analogy: Like the main gate of a society with pre-set rules: “bikes allowed, trucks not allowed.”

Key Differences Between AWS Config & SCPs

Aspect  	AWS Config  	                     SCPs
Type	    Detective Control                	Preventive Control
Level	    Resource Level      	             Account / OU Level
Timing	  After creation (monitors)	         Before creation (blocks)
Focus	    “What exists & is it compliant?”	“What CAN be created?”

Real-World Combined Example
Problem: Company wants no public S3 buckets.

Solution:

SCP (Preventive):
Blocks public buckets from being created from the start.


"Deny": {
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
  "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"s3:x-amz-acl": "public-read"}}
}


AWS Config (Detective):

Rule: s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
Alerts if a bucket somehow becomes public
Shows non-compliant resources
