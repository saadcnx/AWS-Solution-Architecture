AWS Regions, AZs, VPC & IAM 

1. Billing & Regions

On the Billing Page, you’ll see “Global”. This represents isolation because AWS centrally manages billing. Regions cannot be managed directly from the billing page.
Private Regions: Certain regions, like China or US GovCloud, require special permissions and are not visible to all users.

2. Regions & Availability Zones (AZs)

Each region contains a minimum of 2 AZs for high availability. If one AZ fails, the other continues serving traffic.
Example: The Mumbai region (ap-south-1) has 3 AZs, each being a separate physical data center.

3. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Default VPC: AWS provides a default VPC in each region (e.g., 20 regions = 20 default VPCs).
Complete Isolation: Your VPC is entirely private. Even if millions of customers share the same region, your resources are fully isolated.

Bank Analogy:

Bank Building = AWS Region
Bank Vaults = Availability Zones (AZs)
Personal Lockers = VPCs
Each customer sees only their own locker (VPC). Perfect isolation!

4. Billing Alerts / Budgets

Steps to Create Budget:
Billing Console → Cost Management → Budgets → Create a budget
Budget Type: Cost budget (most common)

Example Alert Threshold:
Total Budget: $100
Alert Threshold: 80% ($80)
Logic: Whenever forecasted cost exceeds $80, you receive an email alert — giving advance warning before the bill grows further.

5. IAM & MFA (For Root User)

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): Adds a second layer of security.
Password = First Lock
MFA Code (via phone app) = Second Lock
Setup: IAM Dashboard → Add MFA for root user
If Issues Arise: Remove and reconfigure MFA from the Security Credentials section

Summary Analogy:

VPC is your private cloud colony.
Budget alerts are your financial watchdog.
MFA is the crown of your kingdom.
Never neglect any of these three.
