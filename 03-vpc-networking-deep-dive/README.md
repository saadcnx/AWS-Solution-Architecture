# AWS VPC Networking – Deep Dive

## 📌 Overview
This directory documents my hands-on learning and research while **building and expanding AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architectures**.  
It focuses on advanced AWS networking concepts required to design **secure, scalable, and hybrid cloud environments**.

The goal is to move beyond basic VPC creation and develop a **Solution Architect-level understanding** of AWS networking.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Design and build **custom VPC architectures** from scratch  
- Understand **cloud connectivity options** for hybrid environments  
- Master **CIDR planning and VPC expansion strategies**  
- Implement secure and efficient **traffic routing and access control**

---

## 🌐 Key Topics Covered

### 🔹 Cloud Connectivity Options
- Site-to-Site VPN  
- Client VPN  
- AWS Direct Connect  
- VPN vs Direct Connect (use cases & trade-offs)

### 🔹 VPC Design & CIDR Management
- CIDR block planning  
- VPC expansion and IP addressing strategies  
- Avoiding IP overlap in hybrid architectures

### 🔹 Routing & Traffic Flow
- Route tables and implied router  
- Internet Gateway (IGW)  
- NAT Gateway and outbound internet access  
- Traffic flow between public and private subnets

### 🔹 Network Security
- Security Groups (stateful firewall)  
- Network ACLs (stateless firewall)  
- Internet Gateway security considerations  
- Defense-in-depth networking model

---

## 🏗 Hands-On Architecture Work
All concepts are validated through **practical VPC builds**, including:
- Public and private subnet designs  
- Secure internet access for workloads  
- Hybrid connectivity simulations  
- Traffic flow testing and validation

Diagrams are included to clearly explain **how traffic enters, flows, and is secured** within the VPC.

## 📈 Why This Matters
This section demonstrates:
- Deep understanding of **AWS networking internals**
- Ability to design **real-world hybrid cloud architectures**
- Strong focus on **security, scalability, and reliability**
- Architecture thinking rather than service memorization
